## Abstract

We propose Web Content Integrity, a framework that allows
a service provider to guarantee the integrity of their static
website, even in the face of a compromised web server. Such
integrity guarantees can then be built upon, for example to
implement a secure end-to-end encryption application built
as a website. Our framework encompasses developers, the
Domain Name System, and Web Browsers, and is still resilient
against loss of cryptographic key material. The required data
structures can be generated automatically, and we expect the
benefits to outweigh the introduced delays for most use cases.
